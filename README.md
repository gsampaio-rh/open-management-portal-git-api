# open-management-portal-git-api project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.
If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application

Prior to running the app, you need to create a **Personal Access Token** linked to your GitLab account.

### Running in dev mode 

You can run your application in dev mode that enables **live coding** using:
```
export GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<GitLab Personal Access Token>
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

You could edit your bash profile and make your Quarkus quacky by adding this neat emoji alias, then all you need to fire up your  app is run ðŸ¦†
```
echo "alias ðŸ¦†='./mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=8080'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

ðŸ¦†
```

### Running with a profile 

You can run your application using Quarkus profiles using:
```
export GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<GitLab Personal Access Token>
export QUARKUS_PROFILE=<Quarkus profile>
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/open-management-portal-git-api-*-runner.jar
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application is packageable using `./mvnw package`.
It produces the executable `open-management-portal-git-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in `/target` directory.
Be aware that itâ€™s not an _Ã¼ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/open-management-portal-git-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

Or you can use Podman to build the native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-runtime=podman`.

You can then execute your binary: `./target/open-management-portal-git-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide .

## Add basic JDG to OCP
```
oc new-app cache-service \
    -p APPLICATION_USER=omp \
    -p APPLICATION_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD> \
    -p TOTAL_CONTAINER_MEM=4096 \
    -p EVICTION_POLICY=reject \
    -n <PROJECT_NAME>
```

## Configuration
The preferred place to store non-sensitive data is in the application.properties.

Sensitive fields like git repo location, repository id for residencies, repository id for the config and the GitLab API token are stored in the secrets.
This info is stored in `ocp-s11/labs-test/omp-gitlab-configuration`.

Deployment template will read from the above secret and inject following env variables. These are controlled from application.properties, so if a different env name is needed, change in the application properties file and the deployment template.

* `TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY_ID`
* `RESIDENCIES_PARENT_REPOSITORIES_ID`
* `GITLAB_API_URL`
* `GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`

### OpenShift Applier

This project includes an `openshift-applier` inventory. To use it, make sure that you are logged in to the cluster and that you customize the variables in `.applier/inventory/group_vars/all.yml` - namely make sure that `deploy_vars` uses the correct endpoints. Once these are configured, you can deploy the project with:

```bash
cd .applier/
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --roles-path=roles --force
ansible-playbook apply.yml -i inventory/
```

## Pipeline

The deployment pipeline is running through a `Jenkinsfile` located in the root folder of the project. This `Jenksinfile` is written in groovy.
The pipeline expects the nexus is available nexus:8080. Make sure that nexus is available and accessible to Jenkins.

#### Prepare environment for [ENVIRONMENT] deploy

The first stage is going to set environment vars based on the branch selected to build:

```groovy
master - env.PROJECT_NAMESPACE = "${NAMESPACE_PREFIX}-test"
         env.NODE_ENV = "test"
         env.QUARKUS_PROFILE = "openshift-test"
         env.RELEASE = true

develop.* or feature.* - env.PROJECT_NAMESPACE = "${NAMESPACE_PREFIX}-dev"
                         env.NODE_ENV = "dev"
                         env.QUARKUS_PROFILE = "openshift-dev"
```

#### Ansible

Jenkins will spin up an Ansible agent that will run a playbook called OpenShift Applier (https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier). The openshift-applier is used to apply OpenShift objects to an OpenShift Cluster. 

This stage is going to download the playbook dependencies using Ansible Galaxy and apply the playbook using **build** as a *filter_tag*. This is going to create the necessary resources for our application build in an OpenShift cluster. 

#### Test/Maven Build/Nexus/OpenShift Build

Jenkins will spin up a Maven agent to test, Maven build, upload to Nexus and start the OpenShift build.

##### Test

```
mvn clean test
```

##### Maven Build

```
mvn clean install
```

##### Static Code Analysis

```
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
mvn org.jacoco:jacoco-maven-plugin:prepare-agent install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
```

##### Nexus

```
mvn deploy
```

##### OpenShift Build

The OpenShift build is going to start after the Nexus deployment is complet and successful.

###### OpenShift Atomic Registry

If you're pushing from the master branch the build will create a container image and push it to the Openshift internal registry.

```
oc project ${PIPELINES_NAMESPACE}
oc patch bc ${APP_NAME} -p "{\\"spec\\":{\\"output\\":{\\"to\\":{\\"kind\\":\\"ImageStreamTag\\",\\"name\\":\\"${APP_NAME}:${JENKINS_TAG}\\"}}}}"
oc start-build ${APP_NAME} --from-file=target/${ARTIFACTID}-${VERSION}-runner.jar --follow
```

###### Quay

If you're pushing from a release tag the build will create a container image and push it to Quay.

oc project ${PIPELINES_NAMESPACE} # probs not needed
oc patch bc ${APP_NAME} -p "{\\"spec\\":{\\"output\\":{\\"to\\":{\\"kind\\":\\"DockerImage\\",\\"name\\":\\"quay.io/open-innovation-labs/${APP_NAME}:${JENKINS_TAG}\\"}}}}"
oc start-build ${APP_NAME} --from-file=target/${ARTIFACTID}-${VERSION}-runner.jar --follow
